# Project Login with Authenticated API Consumption

This is a project that implements a login system and consumption of an authenticated API. Below, you will find information on how to access each project via the Git URL, how to set up the environment, and how to install and access the frontend project dependencies.

## Project Description

The project consists of two main parts: a frontend developed to handle user login and consume an API, and a Java backend that provides authentication functionalities and makes the API available for consumption.

## Access to Projects via Git

- Frontend Project: [https://github.com/thyagodcarvalho/login-react-typescript.git](https://github.com/thyagodcarvalho/login-react-typescript.git)
- Backend Java Project: [https://github.com/thyagodcarvalho/auth-api-task](https://github.com/thyagodcarvalho/auth-api-task)

## Environment Configuration

To configure the development environment, follow the instructions below:

### Frontend

1. Make sure you have Node.js installed on your system.
2. Clone the frontend project repository.
3. Navigate to the frontend project directory.
4. Install dependencies using Yarn or npm (see instructions below).

### Backend Java

1. Make sure you have an IDE set up for Java development, preferably IntelliJ IDEA.
2. Clone the Java backend project repository.
3. Import the project into your IDE.

## Installation of Frontend Project Dependencies

To install the frontend project dependencies, follow the instructions below:

### Yarn

```bash
yarn install
```

### npm

```bash
npm install
```

## Running the Frontend Project

After installing the dependencies, you can start the development server with the following commands:

### Yarn

```bash
yarn start
```

### npm

```bash
npm start
```

This will start the development server and automatically open the application in your default browser.
